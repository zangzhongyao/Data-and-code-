# Data-and-code-
Hello, here are the numerosity functional atlases depicted in the article 'Inter-individual, hemispheric and sex variability of brain activations during numerosity processing'.

Necessary data and codes are also uploaded in this repository.

There are 3 folders in this repository:

(1) functional atlas : the functional atlas of each region;

(2) code : the codes and results of inter-rater reliability and anatomical correspondence;

(3) activation data : the neural results of each region, including the volume, PSC, peak coordinates and Z scores.
